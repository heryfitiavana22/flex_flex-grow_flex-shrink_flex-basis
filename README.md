Flexbox properties tester (flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, flex)

## Properties Overview
### flex-grow
Defines the ability of a flex item to grow relative to the other flex items. The default value is 0, meaning the item will not grow beyond its initial size

### flex-shrink
Determines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary. The default value is 1, meaning the item will shrink proportionally when there is not enough space

### flex-basis
Specifies the initial size of the flex item before any space distribution. The default value is auto, meaning the item will use its intrinsic size

### flex
A shorthand property for setting `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis `in one declaration. For example, `flex: 1 1 auto;` means the item can grow and shrink equally, using its intrinsic size as the base.
